Having spent 4 months deciding that I wanted to leave, and a further 4 months applying for a job with AWS, Friday the 5th of June marks my last day as a principal consultant at InfinityWorks, the end of a four year journey in which I have learned more than I thought possible.

Below is the email I sent to my colleagues in the last few days at InfinityWorks.

Hey Kids

It’s the end of the road for me, my last day at Infinity is Friday the 5th of June!  I think Dan B sent an email around last week about this, but I thought I would drop you all a line to say so long, and thanks for all the fish!

Over the last four years at Infinity, I have learned more than I dreamed possible.  I joined IW as a “PHP Developer” 4 years ago, who had messed with a few servers, done the odd security thing and who firmly believed that Docker was not the way of the future, and that provisioning metal was just ‘better’. Oh wow, what a journey it has been, sometimes stressful - but usually brilliant at the same time. I have had the pleasure to work with some of the most talented people that I will probably ever work with, people who are deeply passionate about doing the right thing in the right way for the client. 

I leave with a light heart, safe and secure in the knowledge that I leave Infinity a different place to that which I joined, but that which is changing for the better in many ways.  That’s it, the end, now you’ll have to start explaining to people the origin of the phrase “just be a bit less ‘Tom Gray’” – but I’m sure that will be a good thing.  I can certainly believe that Charlotte and her team will have less to do now.

I am indebted to you all for what I have been able to learn from each of you, and the world of technology being the incredibly small world it is – I’m certain that I will see/work with you all again at some point in the future.  In terms of a leaving ‘do’, my current plan is to pop back into Apsley when it’s back open again (and the pubs are open again) and organise a bit of a session where we can get together.

Also in true ‘those who leave IW and to go AWS’ fashion, I’m going to try and wrangle my way into the Christmas party too, because you all should have the opportunity to tell me to ‘f*** off’ at least once more..

To infinity and beyond. Don’t forget to seize the fish.

Tom
