Recently reading a [blog post on the NCSC blog](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/using-msps-to-administer-your-cloud-services) regarding how organisations should choose their managed service proviers (MSP's) I found the guidance (while appropriate) not as in-depth as I would want to be in recipt of if I was a public sector customer looking to choose an MSP that was 'right for me'.

So let's do a quiz of 'is this MSP the right MSP for me to go to bed with'?

# 1. Do they seperate their customers?

MSP's are a deeper and more attractive target for attckers because of the nature of their multiplied connections in to end-customers environments.  Therefore the controls and guardrails that they need to have in place as organisations are likely higher than what ever organisation you're operating in.  AWS say that "data has gravity" that's true in a computational sense as much as it is in security.  


# 2. Do they operate at arms length?

Too often I see MSP's operate highly manual processes and controls - they rely on well-documented run-books and human action over automation as it's cheaper to implement (up-front) and easier for everyone to understand.  You don't need specialists if their role requires only to follow a set of prescribed steps.

What I like about MSP's who use automation on the other hand, is that not only do they employ specialists - but most likely they have had to think about 'the corner cases' more than the writer of a given run-book.  If they are experienced in running managed services, then they have automation that should cover the vast majority of standard change that they perform (think ITIL standard here) 

# 3. What's their view on reviews?

When I'm talking about reviews here, I am thinking about reviews provided by your cloud supplier (think Well-Architected for example) these reviews can be incredibly powerful in ensuring that you've got the right operational readiness between you and your MSP
